<h1>The DaveKing Skin</h1>
by <a href="http://www.daveking.com">Dave King</a>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This skin is an adaptation of the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick</a> skin that Michael Heilemann developed for WordPress.  Kubrick originally was ported to NucleusCMS by <a href="http://hcgtv.com/">hcgtv</a>.
<p>DaveKing has the same basic look and feel as Kubrick but I have redone it using &lt;table> layout rather than &lt;div> layout.  I did this so that the page would resize smoothly as the browser screen is resized or the font size is changed.  With &lt;div> layout that Kubrick uses the text would flow outside the boundaries of the boxes that contained it.  The other major change is the use of a calendar for archive navigation.
<p>I developed this skin for a simple personal diary blog that I do not share with anyone so there's no fancy links or navigation features.   There is a clickable area in the gray border just above the top edge of the white page that will jump you to the new item entry form that's part of the admin interface.  You will have to login after clicking this if you are not logged in already.
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Unpack the daveking.zip file into your NucleusCMS "skins/" directory.  A new directory called "daveking/" will be created 
under your "skins/" directory.
<li>If you do not already have the NP_Calendar plugin installed, copy the "skins/daveking/NP_Calendar.php" file to your "nucleus/plugins/" directory and
use the "Management -> Plugins -> Install New Plugin" function in the Nucleus admin interface to install the plugin.
<li>Use the "Layout -> Skins -> Import/Export -> Import" function in the Nucleus admin interface to install the "daveking" skin from the drop down list.
<li>Use the "Settings" function under your blog to change the skin to the daveking skin.
</ol>
