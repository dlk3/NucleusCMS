This repository contains a clone of the unmaintained [NucleusCMS/NucleusCMS](https://github.com/NucleusCMS/NucleusCMS) repository with the fixes that I had to make to it to get it to run on Fedora 35, Apache 2.4 and PHP 8.  It also contains the "daveking" skin that I use with my NucleusCMS-based blog.
